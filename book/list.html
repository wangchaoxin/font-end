The definition list is created with the
<dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
    Inside the
    <dt> and
    <dd> elements.
    <dt>
        This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
    <dd>
        This is used to contain the definition.
        Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different
        definitions for the same term.
